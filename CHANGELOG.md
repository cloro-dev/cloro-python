- `client.monitor.*` — synchronous endpoints for ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity,
  Copilot, Grok, AI Mode, Google Search, and Google News.
- `client.async_tasks.*` — enqueue single/batch tasks, retrieve status, queue
  status, and a `wait()` poller with interval backoff plus a `run()` convenience
  (create + wait).
- `client.countries()` / `client.states()` reference-data helpers.
- Typed exception hierarchy rooted at `CloroError`.
